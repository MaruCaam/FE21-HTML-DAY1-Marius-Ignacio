        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        <p>
            She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities So fragile yet so devious, she continues to see Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest Enter the night that she came home, forever Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        <p>She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic My Dahlia bathed in possession, she is home to me I get nervous, perverse, when I see her, it's worse, but the stress is astounding It's now or never she is coming home, forever Oh, she's the only
            one that makes me sad! (What am I doing here? She's my imagination come alive What am I doing? What am I doing here? She's my imagination come alive My imagination come alive, come alive)
        </p>

        <h3>Pre-Chorus 1</h3>
        <p>Hard to say what caught my attention Fixed and crazy, aphid attraction Carve my name in my face (In my face) to recognize Such a pheromone cult to terrorize
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p><b>I won't let this build up inside of me <br>
                I won't let this build up inside of me  <br>
                I won't let this build up inside of me <br>
                I won't let this build up inside of me!</b></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Pre-Chorus 2</h3>
        <p>I'm a slave, and I am a master No restraints and unchecked collectors I exist through my need (I exist) to self-oblige She is something in me (I despise) that I despise

        </p>

        <h3>Outro</h3>
        <p>She isn't real! I can't make her real! She isn't real! I can't make her real! She isn't real (She isn't real) I can't make her real (I can't make her real) She isn't real (She isn't real) I can't make her real (I can't make her real)</p>
